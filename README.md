# Becoming-ML_engineer
This repository documents my journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer. It contains the list of projects undertaken, books read, courses pursued and almost everything I did in the process. So follow along or diverge to you own path, each way, I believe this will add value to any data professional / enthusiast.

# 100daysofmlcode
They say that the process has to be more fun than the journey. So, I decided to document everything while having all that fun. Find my learning from each day when I took #100daysofmlcode challenge here: [@ml.newzealand](https://www.instagram.com/ml.newzealand/)
