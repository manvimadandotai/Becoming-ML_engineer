# 100daysofmlcode
They say that the process has to be more fun than the journey. So, I decided to document everything while having all that fun. Find my learning from each day when I took #100daysofmlcode challenge here: [@manvimadan.ai](https://www.instagram.com/manvimadan.ai/)

# 100daysofdeeplearning
I dedicated 100 days exploring deep learning through mini-projects, research papers, books and shared my everyday learnings with the community.
